# Yates - Yet Another TTS System

This document last updated 2017-11-15T10:35:29Z (Revision 8)

This project borrows a little code from another well–known dictionary modification for NVDA, packaged as the Ultraeloquence NVDA Addon and available from [This link.](http://coltonhill01.x10.mx/files/ultraeloquence.zip)  Full acknowledgements to Mr. Mason Armstrong and Mr. Colten Hill, the developers of ultraeloquence, for their original project and thanks to them both for the borrowed code. Extra functionality may be added to YATES if this addon is downloaded, though remember to download and install it before YATES. Also be aware that some things may break in YATES if you are also running Ultraeloquence, and it is not a well–documented piece of software.

Non–Visual Desktop Access (NVDA) Is an open–source screen reader developed by [NV Access](http://nvaccess.org) The ETI Eloquence 6.1 ECI is property of IBM Corporation, and is, at time of writing, abandonware.
